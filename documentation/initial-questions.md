## What makes a bar a safe bar?
We give bar staff the tools needed to recognize and respond to sexual harassment and assault. Safe Bar is a primary prevention program, so we empower training attendees to be a part of the solution to prevent sexual violence from happening in the first place. We teach individuals how to intervene safely and create safer environments for everyone.
 
## How does a bar recertify?
A bar is certified as a Safe Bar after at least 50% of the bar staff and one manager/owner go through the 1.5-hour training. We provide them with resources and check-in with them every 6 months to re-certify if they have new employees or less than 50% of their staff trained.
 
## Can safe bar status be removed? If so, how?
There are some requirements to being certified as a Safe Bar and if they do not meet the standards, we will not be able to consider them a Safe Bar. 1) 50% of bar staff and one owner/manager must be trained. 2) They must display the Angel Shot poster (Angel Shot is a codeword to get help from the bar) and must display the Safe Bar door/window cling. 3) We ask bars to keep 3-ring a binder that we provide them of resources to reference for behind the bar. 4) They must engage in Safe Bar e-mail check-ins every 6 months. In this email check-ins, we confirm that 50% of the staff is still trained, and we provide more training or resources if needed. 5) They must be an alcohol-serving venue in Tennessee.
 
## Is training the only way for a bar to become safe?
Safe Bar isn’t the only way that a bar can become safer - I’ve heard of individual bars creating their own protocols or forms of employee onboarding training. Becoming a safer establishment can take many different forms with varying levels of involvement. That said, Safe Bar is a community-based group across the whole state of Tennessee that works to create a standard within the alcohol-serving industry. We are having conversations that aren’t always happening, and we want to be a community for others that feel empowered to get involved. The Safe Bar training and program provides constant support for those that are involved.
 
## Can the training be online/asynchronous? If not, why?
We offer the training in-person or on Zoom - whatever the bar feels more comfortable doing and whatever is easiest for them to gather all the employees together. I have facilitated both in-person and online trainings, but we have not done a hybrid model yet. That said, I don’t foresee a hybrid mix of in-person with online availability being a problem.
