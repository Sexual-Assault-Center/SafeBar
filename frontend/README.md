This starter was created using the [Supabase Quick Start Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs) and the [Storybook/Next JS Guide](https://storybook.js.org/blog/get-started-with-storybook-and-next-js/)

This starter also includes a branch [without Storybook](https://github.com/drteresavasquez/next-supabase-storybook-starter/tree/no-storybook).

## Getting Started with Next JS and Storybook

First, do the installations, then run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
npm run prepare
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
## Getting started with Storybook

In a new terminal, start the storybook server (make sure you are in the `frontend` directory)

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Open [port 6006](http://localhost:6006/)
