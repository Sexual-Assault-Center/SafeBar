This starter was created using the [Supabase Quick Start Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs) and the [Storybook/Next JS Guide](https://storybook.js.org/blog/get-started-with-storybook-and-next-js/)

This starter also includes a branch [without Storybook](https://github.com/drteresavasquez/next-supabase-storybook-starter/tree/no-storybook).

## Getting Started with Next JS and Supabase

First, do the installations, then run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run prepare
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Getting started with Storybook

Start the storybook server

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Open [port 6006](http://localhost:6006/)
